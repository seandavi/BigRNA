## Welcome to the BigRNA project

We have processed 187,000 RNA-seq samples and make them avialable here
in their raw format on a per sample basis. The goal is to allow
large-scale mining of expression profiles to learn new biology,
enhance or create analytical methods requiring large gene expression
compendia, and to provide resources for machine learning and
artificial intelligence approaches to genomics.

*This project is a work-in-progress.* To download a manifest of
currently available samples, either
click [here](http://bigrna.cancerdatasci.org/manifest.txt.gz) or at
the console do:

```console
$ wget http://bigrna.cancerdatasci.org/manifest.txt.gz
```

The files can be accessed by prefacing the manfest file path with
`https://bigrna.cancerdatasci.org/`.
