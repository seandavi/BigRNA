This file contains an approximation of the observed 
fragment length distribution. It is a gzipped, binary file containing 
integer counts. The number of (signed, 32-bit) integers (with 
machine-native endianness) is equal to the number of bins 
in the fragment length distribution (1,001 by default â€” 
for fragments ranging in length from 0 to 1,000 nucleotides).
